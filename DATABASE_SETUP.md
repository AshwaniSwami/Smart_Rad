# Database Setup Instructions

Your SMART Radio Content Hub now has custom authentication but needs a PostgreSQL database to store user accounts and content.

## Quick Setup Steps:

1. **In your Replit project**, click on the "Database" tab in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create Database" 
3. Select "PostgreSQL"
4. Wait for the database to be provisioned (this may take a few minutes)

Once the database is created:
- Replit will automatically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- The application will restart and detect the database
- You can then create your first admin account through the login page

## What happens next:

1. The first user to register will automatically become an admin
2. Admin users can access the "Users" tab to manage other users
3. Regular users won't see the Users tab at all
4. All authentication is handled securely with bcrypt password hashing

## Current Status:
- ✅ Custom authentication system implemented
- ✅ UI components and login page created
- ✅ Admin role restrictions implemented
- ⏳ Database provisioning needed (manual step)
- ⏳ First admin user creation (after database)

The application is running but will show the login page until the database is set up.
